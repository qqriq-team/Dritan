'politickakarijera-bio1' => "Dritan Abazović joined the political life of Montenegro quite early. He was the founder of the civic political party Positive Montenegro in May 2012. In the same year, Positive Montenegro won seven seats in the Montenegrin Parliament in the parliamentary elections. Abazovic became the youngest member of the Montenegrin parliament, and after that one of the most active members of the Assembly. However, in 2014, there were differences of opinion between Abazović and the party leadership, so he left the PCG with the majority of members and then acted as an independent MP in the Parliament of Montenegro [3]. At the beginning of 2015, he founded the United Reform Action - URA, an integralist political civic movement. URA participated in the Parliamentary elections held in Montenegro in 2016 as part of the ``Grand Coalition - Key``. Abazovic was re-elected as a member of the Parliament of Montenegro. His open verbal conflicts with the deputies and the leader of the ruling DPS are remembered, because of various scandals, he demanded the resignation of the then Prime Minister of Montenegro, Milo Đukanović. At the Congress of the URA movement, which was held in April 2017, Abazović was elected president, at whose head he remains to this day. He is the first member of the minority people to be elected at the head of a civic party in the history of parliamentary life in Montenegro. He significantly affirmed the party at the international and regional level, and one of the significant successes in his political career is the fact that in July 2020 at the Congress of Green Europe, URA became the first opposition party in independent Montenegro to join any of the family of European parties." ,

'politickakarijera-bio3' => "In mid-July 2020, URA presented to the public the ``Black and White`` platform, which brought together free-thinking people and entities such as CIVIS, the Boka Forum and the SPP. This program included several key points for improving the living standards of all citizens of Montenegro [5]. Some of these points are: the establishment of the rule of law with an uncompromising fight against corruption and organized crime, the reform of the economic system, the education and health care systems, and the protection of the environment and sustainable development. Abazovic was elected the holder of the ``Black on White`` list, which participated in the Parliamentary elections held at the end of August 2020. During the election campaign, he often spoke about the ideas they stand for, and the strategies they want to implement if they gain the trust of the citizens. The goal of the policy advocated by Abazović is civil, European and ecological Montenegro.",
'politickakarijera-bio4' => "Read more: https://www.biografija.org/politika/dritan-abazovic/",
'politickakarijera-bio5' => "In the elections for the Parliament of Montenegro, the coalition ``Black on White`` succeeded in its intention and became a ``scale`` or a decisive factor for the future government. It was their four mandates that proved crucial, because it took exactly that much for the opposition coalitions to form a majority in the parliament and for the first time in the history of Montenegro to change the government in the elections. By adhering to the ``For the Future of Montenegro`` coalition, ``Peace is our nation``, URA contributed to the DPS losing power after 30 years of rule in Montenegro. After the announcement of the first preliminary election results, Abazović stated ``Montenegro, may you have happy freedom``! He became synonymous with change not only in his country but in the region, and was often referred to as a “game changer” and a “king maker”. During numerous television appearances, he spoke about the coalition agreement to form an expert government, headed by experts capable of restoring the country's sovereignty to the citizens. In addition, he spoke about the moves they want to make in order to improve the living standards of the Montenegrin population. When it comes to improving the economic situation and living standards, Abazović's position is that this can be done through two systemic laws, namely the Law on the Origin of Property and the Law on Lustration. Their goal is to check the origin of the money of all officials and persons who have a profit of more than half a million euros. Abazovic often points out that Montenegro has to face corruption, due to which it loses between 150 and 200 million euros a year. He announced help to the small economy that is most affected by the corona virus pandemic, stopping concession acts that ``favor white world tycoons at the expense of Montenegrin citizens``, and selling expensive cars in which state officials have driven so far. He often emphasizes the fact that due to corruption and poor living standards, as many as 70 percent of young people want to leave Montenegro, and that this must be stopped because ``after a certain number of years, there will be no one to defend the state or go to church.`` On September 9, 2020, the leaders of the three coalitions signed an agreement committing, among other things, to strengthen cooperation with NATO, accelerate reforms for membership in the European Union and not raise the issue of Kosovo's independence [6]. They pledged to respect the Constitution, and not to launch any initiatives aimed at changing the state flag, coat of arms and anthem of Montenegro. Due to its specific appearance and background, it has become ``a synonym for the fight against organized crime and corruption and a synonym for unity in which people of all faiths and nations will live peacefully and with dignity and fight for a civil and European Montenegro.``On December 4, 2020, the Montenegrin Parliament voted for the 42nd Government in a row. Abazovic has been entrusted with the position of Deputy Prime Minister in charge of security. Also, Abazovic is the head of the High-Level Council for the Fight against Corruption and the head of the Bureau for Operational Coordination (BOC) of the security services.
 His uncompromising fight for justice led him to a showdown with the largest criminal clans in the country. During April 2021, the Montenegrin police arrested the leaders of the ``Kavač clan``, and the renowned French newspaper L Monde stated that ``the brave Abazović ordered them to settle accounts with the mafia and that he was ready to pay any price for something like that.`` After that action, Abazović received serious death threats, and the police raised the level of his security.
After the confrontation with the drug cartel, Abazović's accusations were also directed at the tobacco mafia. Tobacco smuggling has been the biggest problem in Montenegro in recent decades, and is estimated at billions of euros. At the suggestion of Abazović's cabinet, at the beginning of July 2021, a decision was adopted banning the storage of tobacco products in the free zone of the Port of Bar, and international investigations into smuggling were initiated.
In a short period of power, Abazovic managed to fight for the return of Ulcinjska Solana land to state ownership (15 million m2 - worth about 250 million euros) as well as for the adoption of laws that returned Valdanos Bay with about 18,000 olive trees. to old owners.
